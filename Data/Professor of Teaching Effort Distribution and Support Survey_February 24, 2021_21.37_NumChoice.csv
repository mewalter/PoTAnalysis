This was one of the primary reasons I accepted this position.  My passion is teaching (and, to a lesser extent, service), which is why I was attracted to this position.  Then, after working here for several years, I was told that the rules had changed, and I was now expected to do research.  However, my teaching load (or service load) was not reduced in light of these increased research expectations.  My teaching load is very heavy – not only are we required to teach 7 courses per year, but each of my courses has at least 200 (but usually more like 300 or 400) students enrolled – and at least in my department, the administration typically does not allow me to teach the same course more than once in an academic year – meaning that I am teaching seven DIFFERENT courses throughout the year.  The amount of lecture/course prep that goes into maintaining all of these different courses is considerable.  On top of that, because I teach so many students, I am constantly writing letters of recommendation for students, which is extremely time consuming.  For example, during the period of Sept 2020 through Jan 2021, I wrote letters of recommendation for over FOURTY different students, most of whom were applying to at least 8 different schools.  In my discipline, each school requires recommenders to fill out a different form for the student and upload a unique letter (unlike law schools or med schools, which use a centralized system), which means that over the last few months, I have written/submitted over 320 letters of recommendation. Similarly, because I teach so many students, I am often the first choice for students to ask me to speak to their student organizations – and for faculty to ask for my help with their student issues and/or planning their courses.  I realize that I could say no to these requests – but isn’t that exactly what my position is supposed to be about?  Engaging with students and helping faculty with their teaching concerns?  Given all this (and given that considerable service I am doing for my department, the school, and the university), I have virtually NO time AT ALL during the regular school year to conduct research.  The only time I have to conduct research is over the summer and during sabbatical – but even then, a lot of my summer (and even some of my sabbatical) is taken up by the (compensated) service that I do in my role as the program director for the revenue-generating post-bacc program in my department.  Also, although I appreciate the sabbatical, I would be happy to forgo sabbatical if it meant that I weren’t required to produce research. In fact, I have been so disheartened by this push for teaching professors to conduct research that I have seriously considered looking into the possibility of requesting that I be moved to a part-time position (as I have heard that faculty are allowed to switch to part-time, if they take an associated pay cut).  I know that the school expects me to spent 10-15% of my time on research – so, if I could take a 10-15% pay cut and NOT be expected to do any research (but maintain the same teaching load and service expectations), that would be ideal.  I am happy to give up some money and my sabbatical if it means I can go back to what I was hired to do, which is teach (and do service).  ",7,6,4,"Several years ago, shortly after Diane O'Dowd announced that teaching professors would be expected to conduct research, I attended a meeting (run by Diane O'Dowd) that all of the teaching professors were invited to.  During that meeting, Diane explicitly stated that research would be not be required for a merit review but that it WOULD be required for a promotion.  I took that information seriously and even informed everyone in my department that this was the expectation.  Several years later (in 2018), I had a 3-year merit review that went through CAP, for which my department chair and my dean both wrote that they would have supported an acceleration for me if such a thing existed for my position (which - at the time - it did not, given that we did not have steps yet).  Even though the chair and dean were talking about an acceleration in their letters, CAP was voting on a simple merit for me (seeing as we didn't have accelerations for my position at the time).  During this review period, I won multiple teaching awards (including a diversity-related award), I had outstanding service (including directing a successful, revenue-generating program), and I was a co-author (at 10% contribution) on a journal article in a very high impact journal.  Although I realize that a 10% contribution is one article is not very much, it was my understanding (based on that meeting held by Diane O'Dowd) that research was not required for a standard merit - only for a promotion.  So, in my mind, I was doing MORE than I was required to do with respect to research during that review period (seeing as I did more than nothing).  However, THREE members of CAP voted me for to get a ""no action"" for that review.  Ultimately, they were outvoted, and my merit was approved - but there seems to be a major disconnect when my chair and dean are arguing that I should get an acceleration while 3 members of CAP argue that I should get a no action on a standard merit.  The bottom line is that I can't do outstanding teaching and outstanding service (with my current teaching and service load) AND ALSO do high-quality (or even mediocre-quality) research.  Something has to give.  I realize that I could just put less effort into my teaching and/or into my service (such that I  could ""phone it in"" a bit more with my courses and/or I could say no to service more often) in order to make room for research - but that seems really, really wrong, given that I was hired for teaching and service, I am great at it, and I want to do it.  The university is filled with amazing research professors who have the time (and passion and talent) to conduct and produce outstanding, high-quality research.  Let them focus on what they are great at, and let me focus on what I am great it.  Who does it benefit for me to have to reduce the quality or quantity of my teaching and service in order to make room for me to conduct mediocre research?  Please just let us focus on what we were hired for, what we love to do, and what our students (and departments) need from us!",9,4,"I have never asked to do this, so I don't know - but I wouldn't even want to attempt it!

For example I teach 7 different classes each year whereas some teaching professors might teach the same class multiple times. In our department we are also usually the ones tasked with creating new classes which is a MUCH larger amount of work. There have only been 1 year in the 8 years of teaching when I have not been creating or teaching a new class (or redesigning to be online last year/this year).

I have ended up taking on a larger role than I initially expected as a Board member and now Vice-President of a local environmental non-profit.

I am also not clear if this is actually valued by the university? I provide my teaching materials to others when asked. Without greater partnerships with education researchers, I suspect that my service/teaching have a more significant impact than any research I can do which ends up being very specific to our specific major or classes which, unlike general chemistry/bio/physics/math, varies a lot from college to college for env science.

I feel the true opinion of MANY is 90% research 10% teaching and 0% service. The next person might say 80% research, 20% teaching... 
But looking at the average is somewhat meaningless in this case because it's not like there's a central decision maker about what faculty expectations are. Each person, be they a Chair or a Dean or a mentor to the faculty, view the role (any role) through their own lens. And you aren't affected by just one person or an average of opinions. Ultimately, both teaching and research become 90% each and service still falls off the radar, making the ""effective"" balance 90%,90%,0%.... if we're being honest with ourselves. 

Most faculty do not seem to grasp that Professors of Teaching are not going to be able to produce much research. With very limited resources (MUCH less than research faculty, who in my school have average startup funds of $700k, whereas I received $20k) and time to spend on these endeavours, even if they are related to teaching. It is simply unrealistic to expect more than a very small fraction of the ""productivity"" and impact with respect to traditional research metrics (e.g., journal papers, invited talks, etc)

Further, the type of research these folks (""we"") can, or should be expected to do, is also a misunderstood. Just because someone is in the Prof or Teaching role it does not mean they are going to be equipped, nor should they necessarily be equipped, to conduct ""teaching"" research or research on pedagogy.

You cannot simultaneously expect someone to be an expert in a field (i.e., the reason they are hired to teach university-level content, mentor students, and develop curricula in an area) to also be an expert in teaching/pedagogy theory... that is a separate field of science! That's not to say that some work can't be done, but there needs to be understanding about what we're talking about. 

Finally, much of Prof of Teaching work is INWARD focused and that also does not fit the mold well, especially the way CAP is constantly emphasizing external impact. For instance, curriculum development is a typical expectation from Prof of Teaching in many units/departments. This is very much an INWARD focused task. And further, it is very unrealistic to expect that a single Prof of Teaching will (1) have much impact in the first 5 years at UCI on the curriculum with their program, (2) much less that those changes will be somehow noticed and adopted by anyone outside UCI. For that matter, where does this fall? Service? Teaching? Research? All or none... depends on who you ask. But, regardless it's expected so how do we proceed? How do we make that case? And, if the campus wants us to be so outwardly focused, then why would we focus on this? It's a conflict.  

Apologies for such a long response... but things are much more complicated than just a division of work and/or expectations among three very generic ""buckets"".
",7,5,3,"My 7 total courses are 6 undergrad and 1 grad.  
I think 5 to 7 is appropriate depending on research expectations. 
In my unit research faculty are assigned 1 undergrad and 2 grad. This is an important distinction because grad courses are not nearly as demanding as those in undergraduate (generally). So for apples to apples comparison the typical faculty teaching load is more like 2 undergrad courses per year where mine is 6. This is a 3x not a 2x situation which is usually how discussions go with prof of teaching ""teaching load is 2x other faculty"" 

This balance is certainly depended upon research expectations.

It is also troublesome that the APM describes a process in which unproductive research faculty can be reassigned to LSOE (Professors of Teaching)... So, that implies that if someone ""isn't cutting it"" as a research faculty then they can take the lesser job of teaching faculty which has less research expectations. Yet, those hired into the teaching faculty roles are looked down upon if they aren't pumping out research (regardless if it's teaching related). 
 

",9,4,"It's not an explicit no, but effectively there are courses that I must teach each quarter in order to facilitate the graduation requirements of students within my program. So, effectively it's a NO.",4,"Again, it's effectively a NO, but not it's not that they ""do not work with me"". They are open to changes that are predicated by my developing the changes within the curriculum, myself, that would then change my workload each quarter. In other words, I can make changes to the curriculum that will optimize my course prep situation. But, it's not like that's going to happen very quickly. It takes several years after the degree requirements are changed before the new system can be taught.  ",4,"Again, not explicitly a NO, but effectively a NO.

In my case, students are receptive and appreciative of my alternative messaging (i.e., more pragmatic approach to what I'm teaching and not ""just out of a textbook""), and other faculty are becoming aware of the value this has. So, I feel I'm making the biggest impact within my programs by injecting a more industry/practice-oriented focus on the senior capstone design sequence, which I hope is trickling down into the curriculum a bit. 

I'd also say that through my SERVICE within the department and school, that I am helping to enact positive changes to the curriculum.

","Ah, see, I knew it was coming. Yes, external impact is important... but ultimately we also need to value what impacts people are having ON UCI. 

Externally, I'm producing some teaching tools that can/will be used by those in my field. I received a small grant to perform this work so there's some indication that someone thought it was going to be impactful. However, it's hard to say if other instructors will adopt the tools. Another issue with this, with respect to demonstrating my impact is... it's difficult to know if someone is using the tools or not. It's not like I'm going to get citations. ",1,5,,3,8,,3

I have had to create and teach EIGHT courses for remote instruction since last Spring.  My course sizes actually increased during the pandemic.  Even though I had planned to write a manuscript to submit for peer review pre-tenure in Fall, I work seven days a week managing my course load and students having major struggles (for example, I'm teaching nearly 400 students this quarter with inadequate TA support).  Thus, while I did publish an article in May 2020, which was a nearly 2 year process from drafting through peer review to publication, I have not written since.  I simply cannot contribute to my research expectations right now and it causes me a great deal of stress daily.  ",8,6,4,"I work incredibly hard to meet the goals of academic and inclusive excellence, with engaged learning built into each of my course designs.  However, I feel there is a tension between the campus' goals in this regard, along with meeting DTEI recommendations, and even, how I will be evaluated by my school and department - and the support and resources I am given to achieve these goals.  For example, despite my class size being increased to 250 without my advance knowledge or input in one of my Winter courses, I was only assigned TWO TAs.  When I communicated that, given my course load and two new remote course preps I needed more support, I was denied it.  Number of courses simply does not capture the disproportionate and exponential amount of labor required to manage these courses, which was hard enough before the shift to remote instruction.  The sheer quantity of email, tasks, supervision, content creation and overall management is extensive.  I am expected to be an excellent scholar and content expert, outstanding teacher, technology specialist, administrator, emotion manager, social worker, and much more.  I have spent countless hours attending to student crises and needs, and interventions in a variety of ways for wellness.  I have had to train far more graduate student TAs than any of my research colleagues, and almost never get the benefit of an already trained prior TA familiar with a course and assessment.  I have taken on multiple tasks that I performed as a grad student TA because I have had several TAs simply stop grading in the middle of a quarter, not follow specific rubrics and guidelines, or use the course as a platform for ""wildcat"" agitation.  While I teach labor equity and every course highlights the importance of addressing various forms of structural inequality in society, these moves disproportionately impact my work burden - staying up all hours to grade on top of everything - and it does not serve the undergraduates.  Further, several of these same TAs are rewarded by getting future appointments and funding.  I would love to conduct more research in my area of expertise, but it feels nearly impossible given these conditions, demands, and tensions.  I am also extremely worried that, when faculty are expected to return to campus, teaching faculty teaching more students and larger classes will bear the brunt of medical risks; ultimately, I will have to choose between my health and my job as pre-tenured teaching faculty, despite my 1000% efforts since arriving at UCI for teaching excellence. Finally, I let an opportunity for a book contract with University of Chicago Press lapse because I could not otherwise create courses, train and supervise graduate students as TAs or otherwise, or accomplish my service obligations.  I regularly feel I am falling behind in my area of research expertise, though I was interviewed by a journalist this week about a change in the law.  Much of this stress comes from lack of transparency, lack of opportunities for input, and true inequities in which teaching faculty are disproportionately burdened in qualitative ways that evade typical measurement.",8,"3,4","I don't see how I could teach 8 courses and ""stack"" to have a free quarter, even if they did","1,4","Sometimes; we fill out a schedule ""preference"" sheet, but I am not consulted before decisions are made.","2,4","I work 7 days a week and, as previously explained, it is quite challenging to ""make time"" for research.",3,,3,,2,,"2,4",I have never once been given the opportunity to take a quarter off to conduct my research/sabbatical,3,"I think they ""appreciate"" my teaching and know I teach a lot, but it is not structurally supported with adequate TAs ","1,3","I feel my chair has ""protected"" my time from excessive service",3,4,"I teach and serve over 1,500 undergraduates each year with courses that are student-centered, interactive, engaged, and are mindful of inclusive excellence - along with my passion and content-expertise.

I have written hundreds of letters of recommendation.  I have devoted countless hours to offering career and next steps advice.  Most of my labor is invisible.  Responding to student crises alone is a tremendous amount of emotional labor, effort, and time.  I express deep and authentic compassion for my students and they remark that it shows and makes a difference.

I have done my best to complete the survey based on and using the definitions provided in the survey itself.  However, I wish to flag that my answers and I assume the answers of other faculty responding to the survey would change significantly if the definitions in the survey accurately reflected and mirrored the APM.  For this reason, any potential survey results will be problematic.  There are two principal issues with the survey definitions.  First, APM 285-9(a) identifies three categories of activity for SOE faculty members: (1) teaching; (2) professional and/or scholarly achievement and activity, including creative activity; and (3) university and public service.  Yet, the survey narrows the second category to research, suggesting that “scholarly achievement” is its own requirement, which is incorrect under AM 285-9(a), APM 210-3, and the law school’s standards for SOE faculty members.  Second, the survey definition incorrectly lists many of APM 210-3 and the law school standards’ markers of “professional activity” under the “service” category in the survey.  As a result, I was forced to report many of my answers with respect to “professional activity” in the “service “ section of the survey.  ",5,3,3,"This was another question that was extremely difficult to answer because of the differences in the nature of the courses that professors in the SOE series at the law school typically teach and those that are typically taught by those in the professor series. The use of the word ""courses"" suggests an apples to apples comparison when the ""courses"" are quite different. The three principal courses that I teach have a higher number of professor-student contact hours than most lecture-based or seminar courses, for example I hold multiple, mandatory 45 min one-on-one meetings with each student in the class each semester, in addition to and not counting standing weekly office hours.  More significantly, in each of these courses I engage in multiple rounds of formative assessment throughout the semester and provide detail written feedback to my students.  For example, in my Lawyering Skills I class I provide written feedback on 6 assignments during the semester, providing extensive written feedback on a final and seventh assignment. Providing this level of feedback is rewarding, pedagogically useful, and VERY time consuming. It also should be noted that it is done by the faculty member herself not delegated to a teaching assistant.  Providing this level of formative assessment means that I spend a significant amount of time on teaching during the semester and much more time on teaching than I likely would in a course in which there was only a midterm exam/quiz and a final exam.

Part of the concern is misalignment between how our time is currently and feasibly distributed vs. campus evolving expectations for it, especially incompatibility between our teaching load and campus expectations for research productivity (with not enough time to “catch up” or adjust to those evolving expectations given how long research projects and publications can take, which will only be slowed due to covid). I think my department and School are on the same page and more consistent with my actual distributions (though I think we would all agree I’m overburdened), but we're also looking to the university for guidance about the relative time that should be devoted to research -- with apparent productivity markers that I don't think are feasible with our teaching load and what's implicitly expected with regard to teaching quality and service commitment. As a result, I think to some extent this distribution decision should be left to the Schools so our positions can be more responsive to why we were hired and how we meet valuable, unique needs of each School along with feasible markers of research productivity for our (sub)disciplines. ",7,6,3,"I've been very happy and appreciative with how my department has managed my teaching interests and load. Courses typically taught: 6 to 8 (depending on buyout and how courses counted) + 1 SSP course for additional salary. Courses think should teach: 6 plus any we choose to teach in SSPs for additional salary (which I don't count toward my workload time and distribution above). Research Professor teaching load: I'm not sure but it appears to vary with contract negotiations (from what I can tell) and how research team time counts as course(s). If five is the standard, for example, I suspect it's effectively one or two fewer than that for most faculty but this is based on (very) incomplete observations. Using this box to also comment on the overburdened score of 9 next: To some extent this is self-inflicted given the standard I aim to reach in teaching and service with the roles I serve in both regards (though I think it would otherwise be a 7). My service roles also involve a lot of time neither I nor the department/School can control, such as responding to student issues (e.g., personal distress, professional missteps) that add a significant amount of time and stress in an unpredictable way to my workload.   ",9,4,"I think they would, but the courses I teach typically require a progression that isn't feasible to stack so I could avoid teaching a specific quarter. With a common courseload of 7, it would also be unfeasible (e.g., 4-3-0)",4,"Not explicitly, but they defer to me about requested courses and I think they would be eager to help me avoid new preps if I brought it to their attention as a concern.

This is why I chose UCI as a teaching professor over several more traditional academic positions on the job market, and I've been thrilled to do so in our department and School that really value me and my role. My main concern (apart from the formal title change to Professor of Teaching being voted down) is that the position becomes much less feasible and impactful with the time that would be required to meet apparent research productivity markers at the campus/system level.
